> A docker container for assigning census block group and/or tract identifier to geocoded addresses.

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/degauss-org/census_block_group)](https://github.com/degauss-org/census_block_group/releases)

## DeGAUSS example call

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/tmp ghcr.io/degauss-org/census_block_group:0.4.2 my_address_file_geocoded.csv 2010
```

* The first argument (`my_address_file_geocoded.csv`) is the name of your geocoded csv file.

* The second argument (`2010`) is the year for assignment of census geographies. Available years for census block group and census tract identifiers include 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Additionally, tracts identifiers are available for 1970 and 1980.
    
## Geomarker data

- block group shapefiles for 1990, 2000, and 2010, as well as tract shapefiles for 1970 and 1980, were obtained from [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) and transformed using the `00_make_block_group_shp.R` file in this repository.

- block group shapefiles for 2020 were obtained directly from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2020/geo/tiger-line-file.html) via `get_2020_block_groups.R`. 

- The transformed block group shapefiles are stored at

## Census block groups and GEOIDs

- Census block groups are a low level designation within the US Census geographical hierarchy, one degree finer than a census tract. The US Census provides a diagram visualizing the [hierarchy](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf).
- The first 11 characters in a census block group GEOID indicate the census tract, county and state that the block group lies within. The US Census GEOIDs are constructed in a manner that reflects the geographical hierary of the designated area. By using the segments of the GEOID, it is possible to select data based on area types further up in the hierarchy.

    | Area Type | GEOID | Number of Digits | Example Area | Example GEOID |
    | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
    | State | State | 2 | Ohio | 39 |
    | County | State + County | 2+3=5 | Hamilton County | 39061 |
    | Census Tract | State + County + Tract | 2+3+6=11 | Tract 32 in Hamilton County | 39061003200 | 
    | Block Group | State + County + Tract +<br /> Block Group | 2+3+6+1=12 | Block Group 1 in Tract 32 | 390610032001 |
    
Due to inconsistencies in the 1970 and 1980 tract identifiers, we concatenated the state FIPS (`NHGISST`), county FIPS (`NGHISCTY`), and tract FIPS (the last 4 or 6 digits of `GISJOIN2`) to construct the full `fips_tract_id`. Since the length of tract FIPS codes varied, we padded all tract FIPS to the maximum 6 digits using zeros.
